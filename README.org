#+TITLE: Hammy.el

Work-in-progress.

Example:

#+begin_src elisp
  (defvar my-hammy
    (make-hammy
     :name "Flywheel"
     :documentation "Get your momentum going!"
     :intervals
     (list (interval :name "Play"
                     :length (duration "5 minutes")
                     :after (announce "Play time is over!  Get back to work!"))
           (interval :name "Work"
                     :length (climb "5 minutes" "45 minutes"
                                    :descend t :then 'stop)
                     :after (announce "Work time is over!  Get back to play!")))))

  (hammy-run my-hammy)

  ;; Then you can use interactive commands like `hammy-stop',
  ;; `hammy-toggle', `hammy-reset'.
